File formats

== Source file:

1. The file should be in CSV format; true CSV (comma-separated), not
tab-separated.No thousand separators in numbers. All data series to be
fitted should be included in a single file; the **Country** column
should be used to code different data series (see below).

2. The file should contain at least five columns: **Country**, **Fuel**,
**Year**, **Value**, and **Total**.

- **Country** (text) can be used to code
countries, regions, states etc. Note: it there's only one data series
in the file (e.g. a single source for a single country), you should
still have the column Country for the code to work.

- **Fuel** (text) can be used to code fuel (energy source) or technology. 
Note: it there's only one type of fuel/technology
in the file , you should
still have the column Fuel for the code to work.

- **Year** (number) – year or other time variable.

- **Value** (number) – values to be
fitted. 

- **Total** (number) - some sort of the system size user for normalizing G and L.
If the level of technology deployment (Value) and the system size (Total)
are expressed in the same units, normalized G and L are expressed as % of 
the system size. **Total** should be provided for all data points for
which **Value** is provided (otherwise problems may occur in
calculations).

4. Any other columns can be included in the file, but
they are ignored in the process of fitting.


== Output: a csv file in the same location as the source data file. The
same name with _fit added.

Columns in the file:

**Country** – country, region etc. (the same as in the source file)

**Fuel** – fuel or technology (the same as in the source file)

**Fit** – fitted model (S - logistic, G - Gompertz)

**L** – growth ceiling (saturation level)

**L.Size** – L normalized by the system size (Total) at TMax (or in the last
available year if the estimated TMax is after that year). 

**TMax** – maximum growth year.  The corresponding levels are L/2 for S;
L * 0.368 for G.

**K** – growth constant

**dT** – time to grow from 10% to 90% of the ceiling. Calculated only
for S and G (there are no ceilings for L and E)

**G** – maximum growth rate, i.e. growth rate at TMax.

**G.Size** – G normalized by the system size in TMax (or in the last available
year if the estimated TMax is after that year). 

**Maturity** – % of the eventual saturation level achieved by the fitted
curve by the last available empirical year.

**Size** - system size used for normalization. Calculated only if there
is the Total column in the source data file AND "total <- T" is
specified in the *fitting.R* file.
